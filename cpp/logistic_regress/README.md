Logistic regression is a technique used for classifying linearly separable data. It employs supervised learning to refine predictions through training, thus increasing effectiveness in classifying new incoming data. This method is essential for tasks in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and marketing, where accurate classification is crucial.

In this example, the logistic regression model is trained on a small dataset. The weights are adjusted over several epochs, refining the model's ability to classify data points. After training, we can then evaluate the model‚Äôs accuracy, which provides insight into its performance.

This process demonstrates how logistic regression can effectively learn from data and make reliable predictions.
