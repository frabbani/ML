I recently explored decision trees and found the experience to be very informative.


Decision trees are a tree-based data structure designed to model decision-making processes. They represent hierarchical relationships among attributes (features) in a dataset, capturing the underlying patterns and relationships. By recursively splitting the data based on the values of given features, decision trees create a visual representation that can be used for classification or regression tasks.


For my C++ implementation, I chose to create a decision tree without prior knowledge of the underlying patterns in the training dataset. I built the tree based on the "purity" of the features and their values to evaluate its performance in classifying test data. Purity measures a feature’s ability to correctly classify data, with the Gini impurity method often utilized for this assessment. Additionally, I used K-means clustering to bin large quantities of data (such as age and salary ranges) and applied the Gini method to select pure feature values, resulting in a pruned tree that yields optimal results.

If we assume the following statements: “AI engineers are smart” and “Some smart people enjoy biryani”  the best question to ask to assess if a person of interest is smart would be, “Are you an AI engineer?” rather than, “Do you enjoy biryani?”

By inspecting and scoring our test data—specifically a  group of AI engineers and non-engineers who enjoy and don’t enjoy biryani—using the Gini impurity method helps us ask the right questions such as, “which one do we hire?”
